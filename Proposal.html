    <h2>Website Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of my website would be for people to learn about the Boston
      Bruins. It will also be a site where I will have links to other hockey
      websites that will have more information on the Bruins and the NHL.

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      My target audience would be NHL fans or fans of Boston sports who want to
      learn more about the Bruins as the NHL is the least popular of the four
      major sports in the US.
